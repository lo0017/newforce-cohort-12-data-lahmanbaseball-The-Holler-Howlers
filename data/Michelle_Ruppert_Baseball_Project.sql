--**Open-ended questions**

--11. Is there any correlation between number of wins and team salary? Use data from 2000 and later to answer this question. As you do this analysis, keep in mind that salaries across the whole league tend to increase together, so you may want to look on a year-by-year basis.

FROM teams
	JOIN salaries
	ON teams.teamid = salaries.teamid
	AND teams.playerid = salaries.playerid

--I took this data and used a pivot table to look at the data. You can see a clear distinction that not all the most winning teams are the top earners. 
--Seattle Mariners 2001 — had the lowest salary in the dataset ($4.6M) and won 116 games, which is the all-time MLB record for wins in a season. Meanwhile the Yankees had the highest salary and won 95.
--Oakland Athletics 2001-2002 — this is literally the Moneyball story. Mid-tier salary, consistently 100+ wins. They were finding undervalued players the market hadn't priced correctly yet.
--St. Louis Cardinals — repeatedly 90-100 win seasons on a relatively modest payroll throughout the 2000s.
